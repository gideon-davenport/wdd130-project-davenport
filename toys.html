        <h1>Introduction: </h1>
        <p>The 1984 Transformers series was tied directly to Hasbro's toy line, where most main characters were based on physical toys released starting in 1984. This page lists key characters from the show and indicates if they were turned into toys during the original Generation 1 era (focusing on 1984-1985 releases). Note: The toy line predated and promoted the show, so many characters debuted as toys first. Some show-exclusive characters (e.g., Alpha Trion) didn't get toys until later or never in G1. Based on historical toy releases, here's a selection:</p>
